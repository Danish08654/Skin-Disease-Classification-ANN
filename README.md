# Skin Disease Classification using ANN 

This project focuses on classifying multiple skin diseases using deep learning and
medical image analysis. A CNN-based model is used to learn visual patterns from skin images.

## Disease Classes
- Monkeypox
- Chickenpox
- Measles
- Cowpox
- HFMD
- Healthy Skin

##  Methodology
- Image preprocessing (resize, normalization, grayscale)
- Dataset split into Train / Validation / Test sets
- CNN model training and evaluation
- Performance analysis across multiple classes

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Computer Vision
- Google Colab
